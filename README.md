# SimpleBlackJackCpp
A simple, single file blackjack game in C++. Needs a lot of refining and probably could be written in about half as many lines, but it works properly. 

Allows the user to start with 100 imaginary dollars, and play the great game of Blackjack without going real life broke. 

Includes options to split and double down!

Created for my 100 level C++ course. Enjoy!
